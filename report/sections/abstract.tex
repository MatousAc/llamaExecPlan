  While Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) have seen continuous refinement, artificial intelligence (AI) may be the next technology to propel database advancement. Recent generative AI models have been successfully applied to many tasks, suggesting their utility in databases. This research assess the capabilities of base LLMs in the context of query execution plans and optimization with the intent that the results could be compared to database-specific models.

  For our approach we provide the open-source Llama 2 model with queries and database statistics and observe what types of plans it produces and which biases it exhibits. We find that ...
